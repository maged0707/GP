Step Two (Code Writing):

Write the provided Arduino code in the Arduino IDE application and upload it to the Arduino memory.
Write the Graphics code in the Processing program to display and continuously update the radar graphics.
 ### How It Works:
 

Servo Movement: The servo device moves from 0 to 180 degrees and vice versa, allowing it to monitor the surroundings completely.
Distance Measurement: The Ultrasonic distance sensor accurately measures the distance.
Data Update: Based on the measured distance, the status of LEDs and the sound device is updated to provide visual and auditory signals.
Graphical Representation: The radar displays lines representing the servo's direction and the measured distance for easy data interpretation.
On-Screen Information: Details about the servo's angle and distance are displayed on the screen for user convenience.
Data Analysis: The project offers the capability to analyze distance data and transform it into valuable information for the user.
